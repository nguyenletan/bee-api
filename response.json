Playing and interacting with people and their environment stimulates the senses and creates engagement with others. People receive information from the environment through the senses and process it through the brain which then allows the body to respond.</p>\n<p>Those who have been in very stressful situations, or have had experiences of childhood trauma, may have emotional and body effects, some of which may be related to sensory needs. For example, some children experiencing childhood neglect may have missed out on sufficient touch, which effects their attachment style and could result in touch sensitivity.</p>\n<p>Additionally, parents and children who have experienced family violence may have heightened stress levels or hypervigilance as their nervous system is in overdrive in an attempt to be alert to danger and create safety. This can affect how their body and brain may take in sensory information, process and modulate sensory information and affect their ability to regulate emotions and to carry out coordinated movements.</p>\n<p>In both these examples, the relationship between parent and child can be strengthened by understanding that we each have our own unique sensory preferences, and we can build sensory connections with a view to calming, grounding and relaxing together and experiencing playful times and enjoyable moments.</p>\n"
